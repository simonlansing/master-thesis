# Master Thesis: Migration of autonomous services in the Internet of Things on the basis of topological characteristics

The todays Internet of Things already includes a multitude of heterogeneous objects.
Due to the geographic distribution of the objects, the Internet of Things is currently divided into many individual segments, which communicate via gateways and the global Internet.
All information exchanged and decisions taken by the objects generate vast amounts of data, which are evaluated via cloud computing services in a remote cloud infrastructure.
In consequence of the wide distribution and ever-increasing number of heterogeneous objects in the Internet of Things, this remote cloud infrastructure is not suitable for real-time services because of high latencies.
The solution to these problems is the "fog computing", which is designed to enable a distributed execution of services decentrally in the physical proximity of the objects.
The physical proximity is not defined and extends from the gateways, over dedicated service objects to all other objects in the Internet of Things.

The goal of this master's thesis is the development of a platform that automatically migrates services to the physical proximity of objects in the Internet of Things to minimize latencies.
For this purpose, various characteristics of possible services are analyzed, which can be offered for the fog computing within the Internet of Things.
These and other studies on known topological characteristics form the basis for the provisioning of the services of fog computing.
The platform is implemented according to the specifications of the OpenFog architecture of the OpenFog Consortium and other requirements for middlewares on the Internet of Things.
In this case, topological procedures to record network data and to migrate services were used from previous investigations into ad-hoc networks.
A new feature compared to the technologies of middlwares is the supported autonomy of the provided services of the platform.
Finally, an evaluation is carried out by comparing different positions in a segmented Internet of Things.
It shows that migrations of the services provided within the segments offer the best latencies compared to services on the gateway or in a cloud infrastructure.
All in all, it can be confirmed that the platform for fog computing improves the latencies of communication by the physical proximity between services and objects.
In addition, the results of this master's thesis show that the provisioning of the services provides further improvements in the latency when dispersed within the individual segments of the Internet of Things.
This indicates, that all objects could be available to all persons at any time in the future.
